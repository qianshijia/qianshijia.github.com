<p><strong>Work Experience:<br>(1)Improve and maintain current web service for the company, server side technology is PHP &amp; MySql, the framework is Kohana. (Jun. 2011 - Jul. 2011)</strong><br>
Job Description:<br> 
This is kind of my very first job, and I am asked to develop a web service which will return a result that told the users whether they are in or out of the Zone (zone was predefined by the server admin) while users send their Geo-Location to the server.  If they are in the zone, an activity will be triggered. So that the user could interact with the server while moving around. From this project, I have got knowledge of Web Framework. And I have learned how to build a web service using PHP &amp; MySql. <br><br>
<strong>(2)Android application development. The application is the client side of current web service. (Aug. 2011 - Nov. 2011)</strong><br>
Job Description: <br>
Actually this app was developed by another guy who has already left the team. So I have to take his job and continue. Sine I have never build a complete Android App before, so this is a big challenge for me to do this one. Thanks to my good JAVA programming skills, it is not very hard for me to learn how to build an Android App. I read a lot of docs on the Android Dev site, and search solutions on Stackoverflow. Finally the app is done, and then I am in charge of testing and debugging the app. I learned a lot from this project. From this project, I have got a good understanding of Android platform and other critical conceptions, such as the activity life cycle, R file, XML layout file, etc. Now I believe I can develop an Android App individually.<br><br>
<strong>(3)iOS application (iPhone &amp; iPad) development. Same as the android one. Before doing the iOS app, I had only a little knowledge of Objective-C and iOS. Due to my strong self-study skills, I finished the iOS app in just one month. (Dec. 2011 - Mar. 2012)</strong><br>
Job Description:<br>
Since the client needs the iOS app, I am asked to developed the app in one month. To be honest I have no knowledge about iOS development and Objective-C. But I tell the Boss that I will definitely finish this project on time as I am confident about my self-study ability and my problem solving skills. In this project, I am the designer, coder and tester. This is a great chance for me to practice and learn. When I give the app to my Boss, he said it is unbelievable that I could finish this in such a short time because just a month ago I know nothing about iOS. From this project, I learned iOS platform programming, such as the life-cycle of iOS app, UIKit, MVC model, memory control, etc. I am pretty sure that from this project, I have got numerous basic iOS app development skills.<br><br>
<strong>(4)iPhone App: Simple Financial Calculator (Mar. 2012)</strong>
I build this app for my roommate because he chose a subject called Financial Management which requires students to manage investments using modern financial analysis methodologies. So he needs a financial calculator to do so. I build this App in three days, and after two days debugging and testing it was published on App Store. (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-financial-calculator/id508686931?ls=1&amp;mt=8">here is the link</a>) This app is finished totally by myself, from design to coding, and then to debugging and publishing. So from this project, I learned how to publish app onto the App Store.
