## Just call me Eric or Erica.
I am a gradute programmer, just settled down in Melbourne where I am going to find a developemnt job and start my career.<br>
Geek is my nick name. I like programming, objective-C is my favorite programming language, but JAVA is the language that I used for the longest time(around 4 years). Usually I use Mac OS for programming, Windows is just for entertaining. Most of my [projects](http://github.com/qianshijia), including this blog, were done on my lovely Macbook Pro. New technologies always make me exited, as I enjoy learning and thinking about these new staff.<br>
I am unemployed and seeking jobs hardly in these days. [So I am greatful for an opportunity to have maybe just a job interview, many appreciate!](mailto:qian.shijia@gmail.com)<br>
[Here is my resume]({{ root_url }}/my-resume)
