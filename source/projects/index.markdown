###[Here are my best projects:](http://github.com/qianshijia)
+	**Tagging the Cloud for Android:**<br> This is the client-side app for Android. Actually this projects was just half-way finish when I got it, it was so difficult to continue developing a project which was not written by myself. I had to read the code first and try to understand every piece of the code, during that time I had learned a lot about Android developmentï¼Œsuch as the activity life cycle, R file, XML layout file, etc.<br><br>
+	**Tagging the Cloud for iPhone & iPad: **<br>This is the client-side for iOS platform. To be honest I have no knowledge about iOS development and Objective-C when I just got this job. But I tell the Boss that I will definitely finish this project on time as I am confident about my self-study ability and my problem solving skills. In this project, I am the designer, coder and tester. This is a great chance for me to practice and learn. When I give the app to my Boss, he said it is unbelievable that I could finish this in such a short time because just a month ago I know nothing about iOS.<br><br>
+	**[Simple Financial Calculator: ](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-financial-calculator/id508686931?ls=1&mt=8)**<br>I build this app for my roommate because he chose a subject called Financial Management which requires students to manage investments using modern financial analysis methodologies. So he needs a financial calculator to do so. I build this App in three days, and after two days debugging and testing it was published on App Store.<br><br>
